.

Deprecation Warnings:

Using `should` from rspec-expectations' old `:should` syntax without explicitly
enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly en
able `:should` instead. Called from C:/Users/teome/jeannie/ruby_jeannie/testTodo
_login.rb:20:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'.


If you need more of the backtrace for any of these deprecations to
identify where to make the necessary changes, you can configure
`config.raise_errors_for_deprecations!`, and it will turn the
deprecation warnings into errors, giving you the full backtrace.
